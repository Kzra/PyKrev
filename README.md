# pyKrev: van Krevelen analysis and beyond

# To do:
- include compound classification function based on Rivas-Ubach, Albert, et al. "Moving beyond the van Krevelen diagram: A new stoichiometric approach for compound classification in organisms." Analytical chemistry 90.10 (2018): 6152-6160.
- create empirically dervied compound class polygons to overlay on van Krevelen diagrams like in Brockman, Stephen A., Eric V. Roden, and Adrian D. Hegeman. "Van Krevelen diagram visualization of high resolution-mass spectrometry metabolomics data with OpenVanKrevelen." Metabolomics 14.4 (2018): 48.
- function to create upset plots 
- add package to python database as an importable package using https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
